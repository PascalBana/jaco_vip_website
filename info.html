        If you are planning a Costa Rica Bachelor Party it is Important that you <strong>READ ALL OF THIS!</strong></font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif">FACT: There is only 1 Tried and True Bachelor Party Planning and Hosting Company in Costa Rica.....That's JacoVIP.<br>

          <br>

          Jaco VIP  created and pioneered the Ultimate  Costa Rica Bachelor Party experience. The company, it's owners, and staff  are  long established, deep rooted, and well respected in the local business community. Jaco VIP and has been operating in Costa Rica for 6+ years delivering the most professional, safest, and highest quality Costa Rica Bachelor Party vacations!<br>

          <br>

          As a consumer considering a very important and expensive decision to travel all the way to Costa Rica for your destination Bachelor Party. It is extremely important that you read this so that you can make the smartest decision using the TRUTH and the FACTS, before trusting your valuable vacation time and money with anyone in a foreign country.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif">Smart consumers do their homework, and make smart decisions and THAT&rdquo;S why over 90% of the Costa Rica Bachelor Party groups that travel to and enjoy this #1  Bachelor Party Destination  in Jaco Beach, do so with Jaco VIP.<br>

          <br>

          Jaco VIP&rsquo;s founders/Owners created and fine tuned the Costa Rica Bachelor Party experience over 6+ years ago. Of the 3 gentlemen that own the company,  One is from New York/Florida, the other from Texas and the other from Canada. 2 of us live in Jaco full time and the other lives in both Florida and Costa Rica.<br>

          <br>

          There are several other web sites that have popped up over the last 2 years attempting to advertise bachelor party planning and hosting services in Costa Rica and the Jaco Beach area. This can be very misleading to you as the consumer as you have no idea as to who or what is really behind these web sites. We do and it's IMPORTANT that you know too!</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif">The operations behind these web sites have less then 2 employees each at the most.  Jaco VIP has over 18 full time employees.  All of our employees are legally employed and on company payroll.  We are not a fly by night company who hires people on the fly that have no experience in hosting a groups trip.  Our employees have extensive local knowledge and are thoroughly trained to offer our groups the highest levels of service.<br>

          <br>

          These other operations do not  have the knowledge, staff, or resources to deliver anywhere near the levels of service, quality, safety, and professionalism that your group receives through Jaco VIP.<br>

          <br>

          Some of these operations work out of their house or closet space they call an office.  Jaco VIP has a licensed office with a full staff that legally operates in Costa Rica to assure you the highest quality vacation as well as keeping your deposit money safe.  When sending money to a foreign country you need to be confident your money and vacation are both secure when you arrive.  Booking your trip through Jaco VIP guarantees this.<br>

          <br>

          Other operations try to sell you a package under and All Inclusive Disguise in order to charge more and hide unnecessary charges.  Jaco VIP gives you a detailed line by line charge of every item.  Do not be fooled by the &quot;All Inclusive&quot;  trick.<br>

          These other operations have very few properties to offer.  Jaco VIP has the very best, most desirable, highest quality, safest and premiere Costa Rica Bachelor Party friendly party homes and mansions in the region.<br>

          <br>

          Other operations say they will go out with you and get drunk with you and try and use this as a selling point?.  Our concierges will have a drink with a group, but are there to take care of your group, not get loaded with you as they are there to be alert and look out for you.<br>

          <br>

          If you are required to leave a Cash Security deposit at check in, MAKE SURE it is returned to you before you leave Costa Rica at check out. NEVER leave a cash security deposit with any operation in Costa Rica.  Always be sure you get it back before you leave the country.  With Jaco VIP your deposit and payments are 100% safe and secure with us and cash security deposits always returned to you before you leave!  What happens to your money if you go with one of these other operations and they go out of business, which is a real possibility?  Do you really think you will get your deposit back?<br>

          <br>

          Other operations do not have an office staff.  Jaco VIP has a full time office staff  including an Accounting Department to make sure your money and payments are accounted for and secure!<br>

          These other operations/websites have been on line for a very short time despite what they claim.  Jaco VIP has been in business for over 6 years and there is a REAL company behind the Jaco VIP web site.<br>

          <br>

        <strong>Before you consider Booking such an important trip with anyone else, MAKE SURE you ask the right questions:</strong><br>

        <br>

          &bull; Do they have an office and where is it located or are they running out their house/apartment?<br>

          &bull; Do they have a Costa Rica Bank business bank account as well as a USA business bank account in their registered company name ?<br>

          &bull;

          Can they accept credit cards in both the USA and Costa Rica under their company name,  or is a personal PayPal or personal bank account their ONLY method of payment available?<br>

          &bull; Are they operating legally in Costa Rica?  Chances are they are NOT and can be shut down at any moment with no warning. Where would your deposit money end up then?<br>

          &bull; Do they have an accounting department to make sure your payments are secured and safe. What is their refund policy and how can you be sure your if something happens to one of the owners of the company, your money is safe and your vacation can proceed as planned?<br>

          &bull; Do they provide an itemized invoice/itinerary showing what you are being charged for everything you book?  Do not accept a &ldquo;bundled&rdquo; total without seeing a breakdown showing you exactly what you are paying for tours, transfers, accommodations, and everything else.<br>

          <br>

          If you are offered an &quot;ALL INCLUSIVE for everything including Liquor &amp; Food, then you are definitely getting over charged for each segment and they are simply trying to hide this behind a Pay One Price &quot;ALL INCLUSIVE&quot; mask and gouging you in the process.<br>

          <br>

          <strong>For Example</strong>: If you are being sold an &quot;All Inclusive&quot; package for $175+ per person/per day you are getting  set up to pay far too much for liquor, food,  substandard accommodations, and mediocre service! You'll pay much less getting your own top shelf liquor at the duty free in the airport at San Jose when you arrive and hiring a Jaco VIP top chef and paying a-la-carte daily for the food/groceries he shops for to prepare your meals. PLUS you choose your meals and what food you want and enjoy a much better quality/ variety of food!<br>

          <br>

          Jaco VIP will always provide you with a detailed line for line breakdown of the cost for all segments of your package that you book and plan with us. You&rsquo;ll know exactly what you are paying for everything, no hidden charges or excessive mark ups.<br>

          You&rsquo;ll clearly see that through Jaco VIP , you'll get the best value for your dollar for your entire trip, as opposed to having your costs hidden behind an &quot;ALL INCLUSIVE&quot; disguise.<br>

          <br>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif">Do the owners of Jaco VIP go out and party with you? Of course not as that would be not only dangerous to you as a guest, but to our company as well and extremely unprofessional.<br>

          <br>

          Anyone trying to sell you hosting services that thinks the owners of the company should go out and party with their guests is a benefit to their group, is just is just showing you how little they know about how to properly host groups,  and it's a clear indication they do not know how to run this type of business with the guests best interests in mind!</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif">Our Concierge&rsquo;s will bring you to where the best parties are at in Jaco , join you in the clubs and make sure you are well cared for and kept safe.

        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><br>

            <strong>Accommodations</strong>:</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif">Jaco VIP has exclusive rights to the absolute BEST Bachelor Party friendly Jaco Beach vacation rental homes  - Mansions &amp; condos in the region for Bachelor Party groups to stay.  Jaco Beach or Los Suenos is where you want to be PERIOD!</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif">Don&rsquo;t let these other operations tell you otherwise ,which they will certainly try because they can not rent or use these premiere homes in the BEST locations . If they tell you they can rent you one of these homes but it&rsquo;s already booked, or they have better and cheaper homes that are &quot;just as good&quot; ,  that is a False statement  and they are only trying to get you to take a sub standard home in an undesirable location because that&rsquo;s all they have access too!</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif">If you have a large group, this other company will try and put you in 2 separate houses and tell you these are the best houses in the area and the best option for your group, which is patently false! The TRUTH is they have no access to the nicest, largest and most luxurious bachelor party homes in the region in the BEST locations, which are available to you exclusively through Jaco VIP.<br>

          <br>

          <br>

          <strong>Availability</strong>:</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif">Because Jaco VIP EXCLUSIVELY  has the very best, most desirable, highest quality, safest and premiere Costa Rica Bachelor Party friendly party homes and mansions in the region, the demand for all of our homes are extremely high year round.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif">If we suggest to you that you act quickly to secure the home you want for the dates you want it, because chances are extremely high that we will book it to another group for the same dates! This happens very often where a group decides they want to stay in one of our properties an takes their time sending a deposit and another group puts down a deposit for the same dates. It is not a high pressure &ldquo;sales tactic&rdquo; by any means, when we tell you to move quickly and secure the house/condos you want, in the BEST locations.  It is to prevent you from losing your requested dates at that property to another party that has inquired for dates that overlap yours, which again happens often.<br>

          <br>

          <strong>Other Options</strong>:<br>

          If all of  Jaco VIP&rsquo;s listed homes are taken for the dates you are able to travel,  and you are being offered another property by another company, contact us and let us know which property it is and where. Chances are you can still book it through Jaco VIP, pay less for it, and still enjoy the unmatched service and benefits by coming in under the Jaco VIP umbrella.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><br>

          Before making such an important decision as to who you should trust with your vacation plans, please  ask yourself which option would make you feel more comfortable? :<br>

          <br>

          <strong>A</strong>: Putting your faith and money in the hands of the most established, connected, and respected Bachelor Party planning and hosting company in all of Costa Rica who offer the most professional, safe, and highest quality Bachelor Party vacation experiences on all of Costa Rica.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><strong>B</strong>: Trusting your time and money with an inexperienced, understaffed, fly by night operation with no real experience in the Bachelor Party planning and hosting business.<br>

          Do you really think Jaco VIP would host several hundred Bachelor Party groups every year, with the largest repeat and referral network in the business, if the slander this illegitimate fly by night operation wrote were true..... Of course not.<br>

        </font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif">Smart consumers do their homework, and make smart decisions and THAT&rdquo;S why over 90% of the Bachelor Party groups that travel to and enjoy this #1  Bachelor Party Destination, in Jaco Beach Costa Rica,  do so with Jaco VIP.<br>
